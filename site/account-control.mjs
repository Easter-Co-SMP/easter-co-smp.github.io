// THE ACCOUNT CONTROL, AS ONE MOUNTABLE OBJECT.
//
// This is site/web.js's control, lifted out unchanged so a SECOND first-party site can put the same
// button in its own header instead of growing a copy: the Easter Company corporate site imports this
// module from https://launcher.easter.company/account-control.mjs (GitHub Pages serves .mjs with
// `access-control-allow-origin: *`, measured 2026-10-27). One implementation, two sites - which is the
// rule Owen keeps paying for: the launcher's face, the site's face and the browser's face have to be
// the same face, and two copies of the precedence rules drift the first time one of them is edited.
//
// WHAT IS SHARED AND WHAT IS NOT. The control draws the button, the menu, My Profile, Linked
// Accounts and Sign out, and the face's three-step precedence (picture, then the head cropped from
// the Minecraft skin, then the letter tile). It takes the account seam as an argument, so the caller
// decides WHICH account client it talks to - the site's own module instance, or one the corporate page
// builds with its own registered Microsoft redirect URI. Its dynamic imports of company-profile.mjs are
// relative to THIS module's URL, so they resolve to the launcher origin wherever the control is mounted.
//
// Every rule this code enforces is stated where it was decided, in the comments below - they moved with
// the code rather than being summarised here.

  // ---- The account control's face ----------------------------------------------
  // Owen, 2026-10-26, signed in on the live site: "there's no user image in the `oceaster` user
  // element"; and the next day, signed in on both surfaces: "I am logged in on both web and
  // launcher, but web shows the placeholder profile image while the launcher is showing my
  // minecraft skin based one." So this control draws the launcher's own three-step precedence
  // (site/desktop.js, "The player's face"), in the same order and ending where it already did:
  // the account's uploaded `picture`; else the head cropped here from the account's Minecraft
  // `skin`; else the deliberate teal letter tile.
  //
  // Both images reach this control only inside the account document, as data:image/png;base64
  // URIs - the cloud validates them into that form and publicAccount in
  // site/account-client.mjs keeps that form and drops any other - so the page shows a face it
  // already holds and asks nobody for one. That is not a shortcut. The launcher's first source,
  // sessionserver.mojang.com, answers a page with no Access-Control-Allow-Origin, so a browser's
  // own uuid-to-texture lookup fails as a CORS error before any JSON exists (measured in
  // Chromium at this origin, 2026-10-26: "TypeError: Failed to fetch" from sessionserver while
  // textures.minecraft.net itself answered). The whole texture travels to the page instead, and
  // the crop happens here.
  //
  // The tile is a primary state, not an edge case: the account wipe in flight keeps username,
  // password and roles and drops every provider link, so accounts arrive here with neither a
  // picture nor a Minecraft identity, and an account whose skin will not decode lands on the tile
  // too. That is the launcher's own last resort - #536b66 with the first letter of the name in
  // cream #eedbb2 - so one player sees one face on both surfaces.
